        <h5 class="card-title">Dr. Maximilian von Datenrausch</h5>
        <p class="card-text font-weight-bold">Self-Proclaimed Chief Quantum Snack Analyst</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Dr. Maximilian von Datenrausch is absolutely not a real scientist, despite his impressive-sounding title. 
          His “research” focuses on understanding why computer simulations always run perfectly until someone is watching. 
          He famously developed the groundbreaking <em>Snack-Driven Workflow Optimization Theory</em>, which proposes that 
          scientific productivity increases by 73% when cookies are within arm’s reach. 
          <br><br>
          Dr. von Datenrausch claims to have completed a “transdimensional internship” at the Institute for Hypothetical 
          Excellence (a place that does not exist), where he allegedly worked on quantum banana probabilistics — a field 
          he invented to justify buying a very expensive calculator.
          <br><br>
          His work is entirely fictional, but he remains committed to collaborating with real researchers by providing 
          emotional support, unsolicited advice, and an unlimited supply of memes.

        <p class="card-text font-weight-bold">Intergalactic Visiting Scholar (unverified)</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Prof. Dr. Nebula Starlingen claims to have arrived from the Andromeda Galaxy to “better understand Earth’s 
          strange research funding system.” Although no university officially acknowledges her, she insists she holds 
          a chair in <em>Astro-Bureaucracy</em>, specializing in the navigation of grant applications across multiple 
          dimensions.
          <br><br>
          Her notable publications include “Dark Matter and Even Darker Reviewer Comments” and “Why Earth Scientists 
          Keep Rewriting the Same Paper.” She frequently collaborates with humans by observing them through a telescope, 
          which she insists counts as “fieldwork.”

        <h5 class="card-title">Günther “Günni” Algorithmus</h5>
        <p class="card-text font-weight-bold">Freelance Data Enthusiast & Full-Time Overthinker</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Günther Algorithmus has no formal academic background but compensates with excessive confidence. He became 
          famous (in his own living room) for developing the “Günni Model,” a predictive algorithm that attempts to 
          forecast when his cat will jump on the keyboard. Unfortunately, the model has a consistent accuracy of exactly 
          0%.
          <br><br>
          Günni describes his research approach as “chaos-informed and snack-fueled.” He regularly appears at local cafés, 
          where he gives unsolicited TED-Talk–style explanations about why spreadsheets are “the true poetry of our time.” 
          Although he has no lab, he does maintain a very organized sock drawer, which he calls his “data center.”
